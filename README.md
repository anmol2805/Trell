Improvements can be done
    
* Use MVVM + Clean architecture for better abstraction of data layer
* Divide code in different modules rather keeping in same app module
* Make sub-modules inside each module for data and ui layer
* Use dagger2 for dependency injection and avoid passing data directly from UI to Data layer
* Use viewState to make changes in UI which is toggled from viewModel
* Remove exoplayer and develop inhouse video player for reduced apk size and exception free app
